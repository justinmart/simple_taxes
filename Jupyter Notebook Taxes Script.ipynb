    "This project simplifies the process of determining profit-and-loss for cryptocurrency trades. It will provide:\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed report containing information about every trade\n",
    "A detailed profit-and-loss calculation on every trade\n",
    "A simplified report containing basic profit-and-loss data on each trade (useful for Tax Accountants or for tax filings)\n",
    "A report on aggreagate profit-and-loss from all trades by year, and by short-term vs long-term gains\n",
    "A report on all errors encountered in the process\n",

    "* Put these csv or xlsx files into the appropriate folder inside the data/ directory (the program will automatically parse all files in the correct folders)\n",
    "* For any trades that are from unsupported exchanges, or any other manual trades (ICOs, forks, in-person or on-chain trades, etc) populate a spreadsheet with a specific format (see full documentation as provided in the link above)\n",
    "* Run the script in this jupyter notebook, which populates 5 files in the output folder:\n",

    "    - tax_reporting_data : A spreadsheet intended to be sent to the IRS or a tax accountant which details every trade and the profit-and-loss associated with each"
